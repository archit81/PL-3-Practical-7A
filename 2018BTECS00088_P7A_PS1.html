                <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened
                    wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as
                    anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.) which is then baked at a high
                    temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven</p>
                <p>The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian
                    town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. It has become one of the most popular foods in
                    the world and a common fast food item in Europe and North America, available at pizzerias
                    (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants</p>

                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th
                    century. The word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in Gaeta and successively in different
                    parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there.

                    other Italian foods.</p>

                <h3>Types</h3>
                <p>Given below are some popular variants of pizza around the world :</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>&bull; Neapolitan Pizza</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Neapolitan is the original pizza. This delicious pie dates all the way back to 18th century in
                        Naples, Italy.During this time, the poorer citizens of this seaside city frequently purchased
                        food that was cheap and could be eaten quickly. Luckily for them, Neapolitan pizza was
                        affordable and readily available through numerous street vendors.The typical Neapolitan pizza
                        toppings are fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil leaves, oregano, and olive oil. Since Neapolitan
                        pizza is thin, it isn't designed to handle the weight of too many toppings.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><strong>&bull; Cheese Pizza</strong></dt>
                    <dd>With its characteristic large, foldable slices and crispy outer crust, Cheese pizza is
                        one of America’s most famous regional pizza types. It should be no shocker that a classic is the
                        statistical favorite. Cheese pizza is one of the most popular choices. It will always be a
                        simple, unadorned masterpiece on its own.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><strong>&bull; Chicago Pizza</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Chicago pizza, also commonly referred to as deep-dish pizza, gets its name from the city it was
                        invented in. During the early 1900’s, Italian immigrants in the windy city were searching for
                        something similar to the Neapolitan pizza that they knew and loved. Instead of imitating the
                        notoriously thin pie, Ike Sewell had something else in mind. He created a pizza with a thick
                        crust that had raised edges, similar to a pie, and ingredients in reverse, with slices of
                        mozzarella lining the dough followed by meat, vegetables, and then topped with a can of crushed
                        tomatoes.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><strong>&bull; Pepperoni Pizza</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Pepperoni Pizza is a popular dish that has its origin from Italy. Today, you can find them in
                        different flavor and taste due to its adoption as a popular dish in other parts of the world
                        like Europe and America. Italian-American pepperoni pizza is a popular variety. There’s a reason
                        this is one of the most popular types of pizza. Who doesn’t love biting into a crispy, salty
                        round of pepperoni? Pork, turkey, beef, goat and fish are used for the preparation of pepperoni
                        pizza. Nonetheless, beef pepperoni pizza seems to have more popularity than other types. The
                        most common nature of pepperoni pizza, in particular beef pepperoni pizza, is there their
                        spiciness. </dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><strong>&bull; Margherita Pizza</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Pizza Margherita (more commonly known in English as Margherita pizza) is a typical Neapolitan
                        pizza, made with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, salt and extra-virgin
                        olive oil. A widespread belief says that in June 1889 the pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito, Pizzeria
                        Brandi's chef, invented a dish called "Pizza Margherita" in honor of the Queen of Italy,
                        Margherita of Savoy, and the Italian unification, since toppings are tomato (red), mozzarella
                        (white) and basil (green), representing the same colors of the national flag of Italy.
                        Deceptively simple, the Margherita pizza is made with basil, fresh mozzarella, and
                        tomatoes. There’s a reason it’s an Italian staple and one of the most popular types of pizza in
                        the country.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <dt><strong>&bull; New York-style pizza</strong></dt>
                    <dd>New York-style pizza is a large, thin-crusted pizza that evolved from the classic
                        Neapolitan-style pizza, brought to New York City by Italian immigrants during the early 1900s.
                        The dish began with the opening of America's first pizzeria, called Lombardi's, where the owner
                        Gennaro Lombardi served unusually large and wide pizza pies. Typical condiments for additionally
                        topping the pizza include garlic powder, red chili pepper flakes, and oregano.</dd>
